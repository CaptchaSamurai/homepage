        <p>Once a neighbour have asked me to prepare her son for a math exam. I was excited! I am constantly collecting teaching materials(*) and enjoy math. I agreed. Shortly after doubts popped in my head: Why learn math, if you don&rsquo;t like it!? Can pupils transfer gained skills to other areas?</p>
        <p>(*)<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lJMq4RlHXFFOR5A1g2SWgnPrWf6arS05cO9R7EV_VkA/edit?usp=sharing">Math starter pack</a> proves it.</p>
        <p>Typing &ldquo;why learn math&rdquo; in search engines unveils myriad of praises to the generous influence of the Queen of Science. Most of them are based on anecdotes, intuition, and preferences. What&rsquo;s even worse is that doing mathematics is compared to doing <em>nothing</em>.</p>
        <p>But some reasons to learn math seem to be baked by evidence. Take this one: &ldquo;[Evans et al.2015] indicates that children who know math can recruit certain brain regions more reliably, and have higher gray matter volume in those regions, than those who perform more poorly in math. The brain regions involved in higher math skills in high-performing children were associated with various cognitive tasks involving visual attention and decision-making. While correlation may not imply causation, this study indicates that the same brain regions that help you do math are recruited in decision-making and attentional processes.&rdquo;(*) This is purely correctional. Ironically this study also finds that connectivity and grey matter volume in a few areas at age 8 is a better predictor of future math scores, than math scores at the age 8&hellip;</p>
        <p>(*)<a href="https://www.piday.org/10-reasons-why-math-is-important-in-life/">10 Reasons Why Math Is Important In Life [Guide + Examples]</a></p>
        <p>Pedagogy is creepy. Benezet1935 showed that students who hadn't had math lessons in first years of school performed the same as the control group. As far as I know nobody tried to replicate that.</p>
        <p>I am not saying that learning even basic mathematics is not beneficial, but that I could&rsquo;t find any convincing evidence suggesting that learning mathematics gives more benefits <em>outside</em> mathematics <em>than</em> learning other subjects.</p>
        <p>From now on I won&rsquo;t focus on the alleged benefits of learning mathematics. Instead I generalize the matter to <em>transfer of learning</em>. It happens whenever learning X influences performance of Y. Main goal of this essay is to examine to what extent transfer of learning happens and wander off to topics nearby (mostly the influence of representation).</p>
        <h2>Close transfer</h2>
        <p>Before we look at what happens with transfer between two completely <em>different </em>fields (far transfer), let&rsquo;s examine what happens when X and Y are similar. This sounds like an easier task.</p>
        <p>Wait, but what does <em>similar</em> mean exactly? Well&hellip; nobody knows. I will use it like others - intuitively. But bare with me, we are not completely lost. Take a look at those layers on which two areas/problems might be similar:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Subjective context</em><em><br /></em>How does the subject feel (for example they may be more confident after training)? What is the subject's intelligence? What about the subject's metacognitive skills? In what place and time the subject is?<br /> Gwern Branwen <a href="https://www.gwern.net/on-really-trying">speculates</a> that knowing a problem is solvable (context) might make the problem easier to solve.<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Superficial similarities<br />How neatly objects and processes map to each other (horizontal movement of a ball &rarr; vertical movement of a triangle, is way easier than: movement of a ball &rarr; changing color of a triangle)? Are moves intuitive?<br /><br /></em></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Interface and notation</em><em><br /></em>Is a problem presented orally, diagrammatically, with a physical model, an app, etc? How many symbols have to be used to express helpful things? Does notation have unnecessary features or distractions?<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Underlying combinatorial structure</em> (a.k.a. schema, abstraction)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's easier to learn how to drive a truck, when you are already comfortable behind the car's steering wheel. In trivial cases like this all layers are similar. It&rsquo;s hard to argue that such close transfers do not exist.</p>
        <p>But what happens when we change few layers, but leave the underlying combinatorial structure untouched? Will the subjects realize that they are asked to solve the very same problem (at abstraction layer)? And, more importantly, apply insights they already have?</p>
        <p>To check this, tricky types of puzzles are used. As you probably expect - while their appearances differ, the underlying combinatorial structure remains the same. You can check one of the hardest isomorphous puzzles <a href="http://gocognitive.net/demo/monsters-and-globes-problem">here</a> in an interactive game. Another, less formal, example is the Duncker&rsquo;s Radiation Problem:</p>
        <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td>
        <p>Suppose you are a doctor faced with a patient who has a malignant tumor in his stomach. It is impossible to operate on the patient, but unless the tumor is destroyed the patient will die. There is a kind of ray that can be used to destroy the tumor. If the rays reach the tumor all at once at a sufficiently high intensity, the tumor will be destroyed. Unfortunately, at this intensity the healthy tissue that the rays pass through on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed. At lower intensities, the rays are harmless to healthy tissue, but they will not affect the tumor, either. What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the rays and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?</p>
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>A small country was ruled from a strong fortress by a dictator. The fortress was situated in the middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads led to the fortress through the countryside. A rebel general vowed to capture the fortress. The general knew that an attack by his entire army would capture the fortress. He gathered his army at the head of one of the roads, ready to launch a full-scale direct attack. However, the general then learned that the dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. It therefore seemed impossible to capture the fortress. However, the general devised a simple plan. He divided his armies into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road. When all was ready, he gave the signal and each group marched down a different road. Each group continued down its road so that the entire army arrived together at the fortress at the same time. In this way, the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator.</p>
        </td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><br />Note that not all elements and behaviours map neatly in example above. As it is pointed in Gick and Holyoak1983: &ldquo;The role of the army in military story corresponds to the rays in the medical problem. But whereas a direct attack on the fortress would endanger the army, direct treatment of the tumor would not endanger the rays. (Rather, it would harm healthy tissue.)&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Analogy is spotted not that often. To Duncker&rsquo;s radiation problem I found the highest rates in Kubricht2016: Ntotal = 126, Nper condition = 42; 50% (verbal presentation), 55% (verbal + diagram) and 83% (animation). Lower ratios (33%), with the same puzzle, in Gick and Holyoak1980 and 1983.</p>
        <p>This might be a bit surprising. After all we use analogies on a daily basis. Studies from 2000s(*) confirm this intuition. In natural settings far analogies are used almost as often as close ones. It is a matter of debate how it links with the fact that it's harder to find solutions to analogous puzzles which differ more. And what does it imply in general.</p>
        <p>(*) See Trench and Minervino2015 for short review.</p>
        <p>Christensen and Schunn2007 counted that during weekly meetings professional design engineers used 11.3 analogies per hour.</p>
        <h2>Interface and notation</h2>
        <p>Despite that analogous puzzles share the same problem space, they don't share difficulty levels by definition.</p>
        <p>For example: On average it takes 16x more time to solve the hardest variation of the <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/towerofhanoi.html">Tower of Hanoi</a>, compared to the easiest one (Kotovsky et al.1985). It translates to the difference between 1.8 minute and 30 minutes. Why?<br /><br /></p>
        <p>In this particular example a huge difference does not come from solving actual problem. The difficulty lies in figuring out the rules. Why is it so hard to get the feeling of legal moves?</p>
        <p>In both versions we have three rules with similar word count. But in the classical version of Hanoi with physical pegs (the easiest version) illegal moves are evident. You simply can&rsquo;t put a bigger disk on a smaller one. However in alternative versions illegal moves require mental checking of two (not one) pegs. There is no graphical interpretation of rules.(*) It&rsquo;s frustrating! On top of that moves in alternative versions are not consistent with real world knowledge - analogs of disks change sizes in discrete jumps, unlike any other object we encounter daily.(**)</p>
        <p>(*)Easy to spot mistakes are one of the features of a good notation, as Terrence Tao <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/366070/what-are-the-benefits-of-writing-vector-inner-products-as-langle-u-v-rangle/366118#366118">points out</a>.</p>
        <p>(**)It&rsquo;s peculiar how children sometimes react to situations not consistent with their intuitions. In Clement and Richard1997 we read: &ldquo;A substantial proportion of the children aged 6-7 years refused to move a disk from left to right (or right to left) if there was a smaller disk in the middle (the disks did not have to be put on a peg but only laid down in an empty place or on another disk): a number of children thought that going from left to right implied going through the middle. In this case, the three places, lined up in a row, are interpreted as a road: a move is conceived of as a move in the plane and not as a move in the third dimension, as it should be. This is consistent with the fact that at this age, "moving" has the prototypical meaning of moving on the ground (see Bernicot1981).&rdquo; I found Bernicot1981 only in french. I couldn&rsquo;t verify it.</p>
        <p><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a> points to analogous problems in current coding practice. Programmers have to constantly simulate how a code will be executed. Bret finds it unnecessary. When we code, he suggests, we should instantly see how changes look like. It&rsquo;s being implemented slowly by few, including Khan Academy(*).</p>
        <p>(*) <a href="https://johnresig.com/blog/introducing-khan-cs/">Redefining the Introduction to Computer Science</a></p>

        <p>If representations are so important, who is working on them? Here are at least few of them: Bret Victor (<a href="http://worrydream.com/KillMath/">Kill Math</a> and other projects), Henry Sagerman (<a href="http://www.3dprintmath.com/">Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing</a>), Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen <a href="https://quantum.country/">embed space repetition in essays</a> (they describe their views on tools in <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">How can we develop transformative tools for thought?</a>), <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3Blue1Brown</a> works with animations, <a href="https://theartofresearch.org/a-history/">Vi Hart</a> works with VR, and various authors in <a href="http://explorabl.es/">Explorable Explanations</a> - a long list of interactive apps explaining myriads of topics curated by <a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case</a>.</p>
        <p>I have probably missed many authors. Let me know [@ or google docs]</p>
        <p>Teaching new tools might be helpful (like a software for visualizing logic described in Cullen2018).</p>
        <p>I want to end up with a paradox. Or rather with another sign that things are complicated. Although notation and interface is important, some great figures in mathematics and physics claimed to not think in symbols. Maybe notation allows them to learn quickly, but at some stage it becomes secondary. Or maybe experts&rsquo; intuitions are still influenced by notation and way of presenting problem (Like mathematicians trying to convert to Homotopy Type Theory from ZFC - I read that it&rsquo;s hard for them to stop thinking about types as sets; though I know to little about it).</p>
        <p>The most popular testimony is perhaps a fragment of Einstein&rsquo;s letter published in Hadamard1954: &ldquo;The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities [I emboldened] which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be "voluntarily" reproduced and combined. There is, of course, a certain connection between those elements and relevant logical concepts. It is also clear that the desire to arrive finally at logically connected concepts is the emotional basis of this rather vague play with the above-mentioned elements. But taken from a psychological viewpoint, this combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought - before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others.&rdquo; There is a group of researchers who want to figure this out. In Amalric and Dehaene2016 we read in abstract: &ldquo;High-level mathematical reasoning rests on a set of brain areas that do not overlap with the classical left-hemisphere regions involved in language processing or verbal semantics.&rdquo;</p>
        <h2>Far transfer</h2>
        <p>Linking latin to academic achievement, or even to general performance, probably seems archaic and absurd nowadays. Well, not for everybody (<a href="https://mcl.as.uky.edu/benefits-latin">Benefits of Latin</a>). Please note that I am not arguing that learning latin is for sure worthless. It is beyond scope of this essay. I just doubt that learning latin is particularly better <em>than</em> learning other topics. Thus it is not a strong argument to learn X for the benefits it gives outside X. Just pick what you enjoy.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless analogous statements concerning programming, math, music, chess are more catchy to some.</p>
        <p>On a far transfer level only general skills like cognitive strategies, intuitions, learning to learn, dynamics of being in a group etc. can be transferred. Otherwise one would have to argue that, let&rsquo;s say, there is a structure in chess waiting to reveal insights about the real word.</p>
        <p>In recent meta-analysis, focused on far transfer in music, chess and working memory training (Sala and Gobet2017) we read &ldquo;results show small to moderate effects. However, the effect sizes are inversely related to the quality of the experimental design (e.g., presence of active control groups).&rdquo; This general observation, that effects of far transfer are far less pronounced (if existent at all) when we compare to active group (not null group), is consistent with what I have found in Scherer et al.2019 (*).</p>
        <p>(*)Specifically effect sizes from treated (active) group is g = 0.16, while untreated is g= 0.65.</p>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Training X makes you better at X. If there are generalizable skills learned from training X, they, most likely, can be gained from other kinds of training.</p>
        <p>People are fluent in making analogies and generalizations only of particular things in specific contexts.</p>
        <p>Difficulty of an encountered problem is not only determined by the underlying combinatorial structure. Context, superficial similarities and notation/interface have to be taken into account as well.</p>
        <p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that while training X perhaps won&rsquo;t influence our general performance it may help to prevent decline. As far as I know more research is needed in this domain (Sala and Gobet2017 points to Karbach and Verhaeghen2014 and Melby-Lerv&aring;g and Hulme2016).</p>
        <p>Transfer of learning has huge implications for education. In the drafty <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l39YTUTPTA0RtXnhPnpk1dnvbZMhCgvpVUFeXTfvxjE/edit?usp=sharing">Appendix</a> I collect how teachers deal with transfer of learning.</p>
